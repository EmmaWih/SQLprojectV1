Welcome to my COVID-19 Data Analysis Project! In this project, I've utilized SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on infected continent and death rates in different regions. The goal was to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on various countries and identify patterns in the spread of the virus.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** I used a reliable COVID-19 dataset containing global infection and death records.
- **SQL Queries:** I crafted a series of SQL queries to extract relevant information and perform calculations.
- **Analysis:** Through the analysis, I aimed to understand the countries most affected by the virus and their mortality rates.
